This project is work in progress. The current focus is the server side, which is a Spring Boot project, which uses Java version 21, and Maven to manage dependencies and project builds. Spring Data JPA will be used to simplify interactions between the MySQL database and the RESTful API.

When I reach the relevant step in the challege, the client side will be set up as a React and TypeScript project which has been generated using Vite.js. The intention is to use Tailwind.css for styling. 

I am planning to push regular updates, so feel free to follow me on here, on alternatively on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinaygajjar/
